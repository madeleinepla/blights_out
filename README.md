---------------------------------------------------------------

## Background:

Blights Out is a 2d top down game where you play an altered version of 
‘red light, green light’. The player controls a child walking down 
a long hallway at night to get to their parents’ room with a monster following 
behind them. When the player hears the monster drawing near they have to turn 
around and look at the monster to make it retreat. The player wins if they 
make it to the parents’ room without getting caught. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Functionality & MVPs:

### In Blights Out, users will be able to:

- traverse a dark hallway as the player using arrow keys or wasd controls
- listen for a monster drawing near behind them
- ward of the monster by turning around and shining a light on it
- win the game by reaching the safety of their parents' room


### In addition, this project will include:

- an opening screen and 'instructions' page
- an accessibilty option where a noise meter appears at the bottom of the game screen so
  it can still be played with no sound

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs:

### This project will use:
- Canvas API to render visual elements
- Howler.js for sound control and music
- Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
- npm to manage project dependencies

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Bonus features:

### In the future, I would like to add:
- Cut scenes at the beginning and end of of game to give it more of a narrative
- Additional difficulty levels, adding obsticles, power-ups, etc.
